# typescript-sandbox

This is meant to replicate the convenience of the [Vanilla Typescript CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-typescript-vanilla-ts), but locally.

`npm run start` does the following:
- Recompiles typescript to javascript on save
- Serves an `index.html` that runs the compiled javascript via local webserver with live reloading
